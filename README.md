Matrix: A matrix is a system of m n numbers, arranged in a rectangular array where we have m horizontal lines and n vertical lines, here horizontal lines are called rows and vertical lines are called columns and this is called as my by n or m cross n and represented by m x n

Types of Matrix:

Row Matrix: A Row Matrix contains only one row and any number of colums

Column Matrix: A columc matrix contains only one column and any number of rows

Square Matrix: # rows equal to # colums vise versa

Diagnol Matrix: A Square Matrix with all non diagonal elements should be '0'. Left to right diagonal called principal diagonal or leading diagonal, the other diagonal called non   principal or non leading diagonal

Scalar Matrix: A diagonal matrix with all diagonal elements should be equal to k which is a scalar value (k=2, k=5, k=-21, ..... k=any value)

Unit or Identity Matrix: A scalar Matrix where k=1

NUll Matrix: A matrix with all zeros

Sub Matrix: A Matrixh which is obtained from a given matrix by deleting any number of rows or any number of ccolumns

Upper Traingular Matrix: For all the elements below the leading diagonal are zero

Lower Traingular Matrix: For all the elements above the leading diagonal are zero

Transpose Matrix: Transpose is not a matrix, it is an operation on a matrix. If we interchange rows and with the corresponding columns of a given matrix, A, the new matrix obtained is called Transpose of a matrix. It is denoted as AT or A'
